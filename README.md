## CPP Practice

### 1. Callback passing
- Testing the callback function passing from class A to class B.
- The lambda callback function created in A and pass to B
- B will use it whenever neccessary

So B will depends on A (Because B has to have the callback function which is sent by A, so B init after A init)
```
cd callback
```
